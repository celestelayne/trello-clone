# Plan for the rest of the work

[1] There a bug in the drop function. React Dev Tools shows the function attaced to the BoardColumn component; however, it has not firing the logs in the function to the console, so there is something wrong there.

[2] Create functionality. I've already set up the event handler to log a click to the console. The logic needs to be added.

[3] Create Validations. Set up validations on the input field so that users cannot submit an empty card.

[4] Clean up the CSS to be consistent across the three viewports.

# Completed Functionality

[ ] User can create a new card
[ ] User can drag any card
[X] Horizontal scroll on the mobile view


# Tools

[X] React
[X] HTML Drag Drop API
